# Example

## Setup

First, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the server by running:

```bash
python parrot.py
```

Leave the terminal open to keep the server running. Open a new terminal window to set up and start the client.

Install Node if you don't have it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then run:

```bash
npm init
```

```bash
npm start
```

This should automatically launch the client in your browser, and the client should be able to communicate with the server.
